Description: Provides recent kernel density estimation methods for circular data, including adaptive and higher-order techniques. The implementation is based on recent advances in bandwidth selection and circular smoothing. Key methods include adaptive bandwidth selection methods (Zámečník et al. 2024), complete cross-validation (Hasilová et al. 2024), Fourier-based plug-in rules (Tenreiro 2022), and higher-order kernels (Tsuruta & Sagae 2017).
Keywords: circular data, kernel density estimation, bandwidth selection, directional statistics, smoothing
